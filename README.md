# 100 — My Journey Learning Backend in 100 Days

This repo documents my personal journey of learning **backend development** over 100 days using the **MEN stack** (MongoDB, Express, Node.js). Every day = a step forward in building real backend skills. No fluff, just grind.

## Project Structure

```


## Tech Stack

- **MongoDB** – NoSQL Database
- **Express.js** – Backend Framework
- **Node.js** – Runtime Environment


## Features

- 100-day log of learning backend
- Well-organized folder structure
- Real backend projects and experiments
- Personal notes, errors, and solutions


## Running Locally

To clone and explore the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Njoxpy/100
cd 100
```

Navigate to any day's folder to run backend projects:

```bash
cd 100/1/src
# Run specific day's projects as needed
node main.js
```

*Check the `docs/` folder for project writeups and learning notes.*


## Daily Progress

Each numbered folder (1/, 2/, etc.) represents a day in the 100-day journey:

- **Day folders** contain both source code and documentation
- **Progress tracking** through daily commits and notes
- **Incremental learning** building upon previous days' work

## Goals

- Master MongoDB database operations and design
- Build robust Express.js APIs and middleware
- Develop scalable Node.js backend applications
- Create real-world projects demonstrating full-stack capabilities
